          "message": "test(mongo): measure the rows MongoDB holds, not its commands\n\nThe case read serverStatus opcounters, and those counters are global to the mongod, so it first had to prove that no other client wrote inside the window before the number could be read as its own work. In a shared test JVM that proof cannot hold: other test classes in the same worker keep connection pools open, so connections.current never falls to this test's own two and the guard fires every run. CI showed exactly that - the job was green while the case aborted as unattributable, which means MongoDB had no number at all rather than a wrong one.\n\nRows need no guard. The collection's own document count is per-collection by construction, so the server is answering about this test's work and nothing else, and the count is taken through the verification client rather than the implementation, so it is MongoDB's answer about its own store rather than the plugin agreeing with itself. The opcounters sampling, the empty control block, the delta and the attribution guard are gone, and the fingerprint now reads buildInfo instead of serverStatus so that no global counter appears in the test at all. The assertion is unchanged in spirit: every row the plugin was handed must be in the collection, while the shape of the command the driver chose is neither reported nor asserted, because that belongs to the driver.",
